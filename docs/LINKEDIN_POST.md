## Version 1: Main Post

**📊 Built a Data Analysis Agent that cuts AI analysis costs by 70-90%**

Ever watched your API budget vanish analyzing datasets with ChatGPT?

I built an AI-powered Data Analysis Agent that makes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 50-100x cheaper by compressing what you send to LLMs — without losing critical insights.

**💸 The problem?**
• Traditional AI tools resend entire dataset schemas every time ($2-5 per analysis)
• Complete analysis histories bloat token usage
• Large datasets = massive API costs
• Running 100 analyses/month? That's $200-500 burned on redundant data

**✨ My solution? Compress smart, analyze fast.**

Built a tool that:
• Shrinks dataset schemas by 50-2000x (10MB → 5KB) using intelligent compression
• Reduces analysis history by 5-20x while preserving context
• Automates EDA: missing values, correlations, outliers, distributions
• Integrates with ScaleDown API for ultra-compression
• Works with any LLM (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
• Web interface + CLI + Jupyter notebooks

**🎯 The result:**
✅ 70-90% cost savings on every analysis
✅ Full EDA automation with AI suggestions
✅ Maintains semantic meaning despite compression
✅ Scales to massive datasets (millions of rows)
✅ Ready to deploy (Streamlit web app included)

**🛠 Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, ScaleDown API, Streamlit, OpenAI

Perfect for data scientists, ML engineers, and analysts tired of expensive cloud API bills.

## Customization Tips

**Personalize the opening:**
- Share your own experience: "After spending $300 on API calls in one month..."
- Add specific use case: "While analyzing customer churn data..."

**Add metrics:**
- Replace generic numbers with your actual testing results
- Include specific dataset examples you've tested

**Engagement hooks:**
- End with a question: "What's your biggest data analysis pain point?"
- Add a call to action: "Drop a 💡 if you want to see a demo"

## Version 2: Technical Deep Dive

**🧠 How I reduced LLM token usage by 50-2000x for data analysis**

Built a compression-first EDA agent that makes AI-powered analytics affordable at scale.

**The architecture:**

1️⃣ **Schema Compression Layer**
   • Extracts metadata: types, stats, cardinality, missing ratios
   • Generates compact representations
   • 50-2000x reduction (10MB dataset → 5KB prompt)

2️⃣ **History Compression Engine**
   • Tracks analysis steps with causal relationships
   • Archives old context intelligently
   • Preserves key insights while cutting 80% of tokens

3️⃣ **AI Agent Core**
   • Automated EDA with GPT-4/Claude integration
   • Smart suggestions for next analytical steps
   • Generates visualizations and insights

**Why this matters:**
Standard approach: 100K tokens per analysis × $0.01/1K = $1 per run
My approach: 2K tokens per analysis × $0.01/1K = $0.02 per run
**= 98% cost reduction**

Built with Python, Pandas, ScaleDown API, Streamlit
